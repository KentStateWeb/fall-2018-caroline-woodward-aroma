        <p>With over ten years experience roasting coffee, we source and roast a variety of estate and co-op coffees as well as a few specialized blends while valuing the importance of transparency, fairness, and quality at each step of the process from seed to cup. <br> <br> We specialize in small batch, air-cooled roasting. Our batch size (20-30 lbs. per batch) is small enough to give us good control and flexibility with our roast profile, and large enough to give a good amount of bean-to-bean radiant heat transfer and roast evenness. We exclusively air-cool our beans because water-quenching degrades flavor intensity and clarity. <br> <br> We personally source our beans, perfect them through the art/science of precision roasting, and supply them to select restaurants and retail establishments. </p>

        <h1> the art of coffee </h1>
        <h2> Roasting coffee to perfection is exacting, but not mysterious. Hereâ€™s how we do it: </h2>
        <ol>
        <li> Travel the globe to find the best coffee beans. </li>
        <li> Buy entire micro-lots of great beans at a fair price. </li>
        <li> Roast with artistry and advanced technology. </li>
        <li>Control quality from grower to roaster to barista to consumer.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div class="smaller">
        <h1> smaller is better </h1>
        <p> Many of our specialty beans come from a single farm or even from a specific area on the farm, so they are limited in quantity and superior in quality. We buy directly from the farmers and have established strong, long-term relationships, based on good coffee and fair prices.</p>
